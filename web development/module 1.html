    <p> <b>A school is an educational institution (and, in the case of in-person learning</b> 
        <i>, <u>the building</u>) designed to provide learning environments for the teaching of students, usually under the direction of teachers.</i> Most countries have systems of formal education, which is sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools that can be built and operated by both government and private organization. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional terms section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a university college or university.</p>
